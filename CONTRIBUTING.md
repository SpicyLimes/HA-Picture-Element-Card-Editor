## Development Setup

The source code is located in the root directory. To run the project locally for development:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite dev server, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.
